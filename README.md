Once the app is up and running using rails server, create an account in rails console using this line:

User.create!({:username => "username", :email => "email", :password => "pw", :password_confirmation => "pw" })

where username is the test account username, email is the test account email and pw is a password which meets the constraints, e.g. 111111

Use these details to log in to the app and navigate.
